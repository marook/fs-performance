Introduction

fs-performance is a very alpha tool to measure file system performance. As we
are ultra alpha we only support measuring directory list operations.

Usage

$ python src/fs-performance target-dir

Output

Here's some example output:

lsSensor: [measurements: 2606, sum: 191.235429525, min: 0.000104904174805s, max: 0.841929912567s, average: 0.0733827434863s, median: 0.000216960906982s]
Overall time: 206.110818863s 

Right now there is only one sensor which measures list directory content
operations. The values above mean the following:

* measurements - there have been 2606 directory listings
* sum - this is the summed up duration in seconds of all lsSensor invocations
* min - this was the duration in seconds of the fastest measured invocation
* max - this was the duration in seconds of the slowest measured invocation
* average - this is the average invocation duration in seconds
* median - this is the median invocation duration in seconds
